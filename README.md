#  Fast Next.js – Debunking the "It's Slow" Myth

Many developers today debate whether **Next.js** is becoming too slow, with some even suggesting a return to **vanilla JavaScript**. But here's the truth: Next.js is not slow — it's **often misunderstood or misused**.

In this blog, we’ll break down:

-  Why some think Next.js is slow  
-  How Next.js rendering works  
-  Common performance mistakes  
-  Best practices for high-speed apps  
-  Example

##  How Next.js Handles Rendering

Next.js provides flexible rendering strategies:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **SSG** | Static Site Generation – pre-renders at build time |
| **SSR** | Server-Side Rendering – renders per request |
| **ISR** | Incremental Static Regeneration – updates statically after deployment |
| **CSR** | Client-Side Rendering – fetches/render data on browser |

**Use the right strategy for the right page.**

## Why Some Say It's "Slow"

> It’s not the framework — it’s how people use it.

Common performance killers include:

- Overusing SSR when SSG would work
- Not caching API responses
- Too many `useEffect`-based fetches
- Rendering large components too early
- Not optimizing media (images/videos)

## Best Practices for Blazing-Fast Apps

From our real e-commerce project:

- Use **SSG + ISR** for category & product pages  
-  Cache APIs with **Redis or Memcached**  
-  Use **SWR / React Query** for frontend data fetching  like (Query-react)
- Use **Next/Image** for image optimization  
- Add **Edge Middleware** for smart personalization  
-  Optimize Lighthouse + Core Web Vitals  

---

##   E-Commerce Example

**Problem:** Sluggish product load
**Solution:**  
- Cached product pages with ISR  
- Fast cart interactions via in-memory APIs  
- Optimized image loading & lazy rendering  
- Fewer JS bundles and smarter dynamic imports

**Case 2: 3G + disable Cached Resources**

Result: increase preformance and fetching images!

##  Final Thoughts

Next.js is **not the problem** — it’s one of the best frameworks when used right.

> “Don’t blame the tool. Learn to wield it better.”

Understand rendering modes, use caching wisely, and lean into Next.js features for production-ready performance.
